Sampling with 2 Gaussian distributions in the angular spread, transversal size, and waist. 

Note: 
-- Posterior distribution on the pixel size is very different from the prior distribution -> the model is possibly wrong. 

To do: 
-- Check whether fixed/truncated prior on the pixel size leads to the better agreement.
