Benchmark-5: Used for MCMC analysis with 41D. Constant resolution. 
Benchmark-6: Used to generate simulated event. 
Benchmark-7: Used for MCMC with 41D and varying resolution function. 
Benchmark-8: Used to compare 41D and 35D using HC2 event. 
Benchmark-9: Used to learn alignment of the bunch 
Benchmark-10: Long run with 1-Gaussian model. 
Benchmark-11: Rotation of the bunch for two models (event HC2). 
Benchmark-12: Impact of the pixel size uncertanity and the resolution effects on both models. AHMI is used to compare models. Priors ae adjusted  (event HC2). To test smearing effects, HC220 event is used. 
Benchmark-13: Effect of the resolution function on the IS2. (event HC2)
Benchmark-14: Axisymmetrical bunch fit (Single Gaussian)
Benchmark-15: Axisymmetrical bunch fit (Double Gaussian)
Benchmark-16: Test of data truncation 
Benchmark-17: Test of background on Cam.4, add noise 
Benchmark-5-b: Added additional fluctuations to the IS2 camera.
