Sampling with 2 Gaussian distributions in the angular spread, transversal size, and waist. Pixel sizes are fixed for all cameras. Resolution function is fixed for the first 3 cameras. 

Proton bunch is approximated using CDF function. 

Description of files: 

1-Samples-Demo-41.ipynb - Check contours of 1 event
2-SummaryFile.ipynb - summary file is created with shifted alignments of cameras. physics parameters and std are stored. 
3-Analysis_Samp-41.ipynb - analysis of 40 events using MCMC samples. Long file, no summary data.  (summary file is used)
4-Analysis_Cov.ipynb - Covariance matrix is computed for samples and events. 
5-Plotly-trace.ipynb - Plotly is used to mke 3D visualizations 
6-Resolution - samples with constant and varying resolution function are compared.
